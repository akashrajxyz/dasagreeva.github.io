<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>let’s concern ourselves with arming you with
better means, methods and mechanisms to deflect and deal with shit that has
happened to you, is happening to you and will happen to you.</li>

<li>Let’s start with you. You are a product. You are a product with hope
attached to it. What does that mean? It means that, one day, you are meant to
become this awesome, functional unit capable of choosing jobs, careers,
relationships, environments and economies on your own volition—that’s the
hope. The better the choices, the better the product you are—that’s the simple
law on the basis of which the world judges you.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>‘Emotional responses’ is a garbage teacher, because as a kid, the
emotional intelligence is underdeveloped.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>Anyway, when the time comes, a lot of them will take complete
advantage of you, rid you of your emotional innocence and turn your world
upside down. It will most definitely happen, history tells you that, no matter
who you are or what you do—rich, talented, genius, pretty, strong, powerful,
polite, kind, or careful.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Specialness is the badge of realisation you earn. It may seem very
simple to you, but this thinking can change the course of your life. Any
achievement dictates you have created or mastered something. This means
that not only did you gain in terms of knowledge, but you built habits of
discipline, hard work, prioritising and focusing—habits that will serve you in
almost all aspects of life.</li>
<li>becomes a reference point for yourself in the future—I was able to achieve
this, this is who I am— but also proves to yourself that you have what it takes
to be capable—I believe I can achieve anything I put my mind to.</li>

<li>Whatever the case may be, the right to feel special
must be earned and must only be yours to give. It shouldn’t belong to others
because:</li>
<li>Why am I special? What
have I done in my life?, and get a clear answer. In case you feel dissatisfied,
then you have the option to earn it. Nobody gives it to you, you have to take
it. But that’s the hard part, earning it.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You wanna do this, right?
This may seem like a very simple question, but, my friend, there is a
difference between wanting to do something and having to do something.
Most people in this world are doing what they do not because they want to,
but because they have to. Having to do something becomes a duty you have
to fulfil. Wanting to do something is a choice. Therefore, to win, the very
first thing you need to clarify in your mind is, do you really wanna do this?</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A hunger for money , status , power</li>
<li>a hunger to avoid poverty , desperation , conditions you wouldn&rsquo;t
want to go back to ever again</li>
<li>a hunger to prove in your own eyes that you are capable (which would
be the concept of being special)</li>
<li>a hunger to provide for those whom you love and are dependent on you</li>
</ul>


<p>
Success is a matter of choice
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>What traditional winning looks like
this is basically how society crowns a
winner. The results of any competition declare a winner and the losers.
Society celebrates the winner and ignores the losers</li>
<li>How real winning works
one wins after having failed time after time. Theessence behind real winning is not giving up, no matter what badges and
medals society is handing out. When it comes to your ‘heroes’ and those who
define success and hard work for you, you see them the same way</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
You want to be special. This specialness is not about being superficial, it is
about being capable
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Utility asks you: what’s the use of what you are learning? In how many
areas, fields of study and practices can it be implemented? How much self-
belief does this learning generate in you? How much self-value does it
provide? Does it have value in the long term, in the market? And lastly, at
what point does whatever you are learning start to have real utility in terms of
success? Basically, where do you stand right now? Thinking in terms of
utility makes you realise that there is a real world out there, away from your
frog-well, with real competition, and the trophies you may be collecting are
mere indicators that you are on the right path, but you haven’t actually won.</li>

<li>Opportunity asks you: how can you use what you are learning? How many
doors will it open for you? In how many ways can you capitalise on this
skill? How many opportunities does it have in the marketplace? What’s the
full potential of this skill if learned until you are an expert? Where is the
geographic hub for opportunities for this skill? Thinking in terms of
opportunity gives you ambition. Ambition gives you seriousness. With
ambitious goals, the nature of its utility in your mind is revised and reset as
well.</li>

<li>Ability asks you: how well can you do what you are learning? Do you have a
natural talent for this? Are you able to learn this faster than others? Are you
slower than others? If yes, then despite being slower, are you able to beat the
competition or stand on par by working harder than them? Success cares
about nothing but results. Are you able to think creatively, which means can
you create new opportunities from the existing ones? Are you able to think
cleverly? Thinking in terms of abilities makes you aware of where you stand
right now and where your ambition requires you to be standing.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>failures are normal</li>
<li>First, you take ownership of the failure. It’s very different from acting as
if you have been stung by failure. Both are similar realisations, but come
from different points of view. The first makes you responsible, the other a
victim. Instead of finding tendencies, people and relationships to blame, you
make yourself fully responsible for that failure. This is step one of the
investigation. I deserve this. Whatever impact this failure causes, I deserve
and take responsibility for it. Once you take ownership, it becomes your
fuck-up. You are not a victim, it didn’t happen to you, you caused it. Once
you own it</li>
<li>After ownership begins assessment: Why did I fail? Assessment
produces findings about your abilities, habits, relationships and the people in
your life. For example, what was your approach going into the competition—
serious or lazy? Did your approach include following a plan, routine, daily

<p>
Your major struggle in life is to be happy; it is not to be satisfied
satisfation offer a state of mind called peacefulness. You would be at peace with
yourself. And this is also where the problem comes: to be at peace with yourself,
you will have to know your ‘self’ first
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Self-Belief
the knowledge of self produces self-belief
It’s as simple as this: you are unsure and scared of what you don’t
know; you’re confident and comfortable with things you know.</li>
<li>What does your self want ?</li>
<li>What you don&rsquo;t want !
Furthermore, the knowledge of self produces the knowledge of what you
don’t want, which is far more important than knowing what the self wants.
Therefore, knowing well what your ‘self’ doesn’t want improves your
decision-making abilities. This enables your view of yourself as an
individual, and it also gives your identity uniqueness in the eyes of people.</li>
<li>What makes your self happy ?
So, as a recap, what makes you happy is, one, doing things that are
generally known to make people happy, and two, having theoretical ideas and
fantasies regarding what would make you happy in the future.
What makes your self happy is knowing clearly what activities give you
joy, and what would give you satisfaction in the long run.</li>

<h3 id="orgd7ccfaf"><span class="section-number-3">8.2</span> Why do we chase after happiness like junkies ?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-8-2">
<p>
The problem with responding more to feeling good is that chances are
you may become a person who just focuses on feelings rather than thinking.
Feeling-based sounds something like: This makes me feel good,
therefore this is good. I want it. Thinking-based sounds like: Just because
something makes me feel good doesn’t mean it’s good. I will think about if I
really want it.
the fact that feelings change all the fucking time.
why most of us remain feeling-based happiness junkies:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In short, happiness is a by-product of life done right. And I
hope this does not come as a surprise, but doing things right requires
thinking, a lot of it.</li>

<div id="outline-container-org4517dba" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4517dba"><span class="section-number-4">8.2.1</span> How happiness screws you over and over!</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-8-2-1">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Why am I not happy even though I have a great life?
It’s because ‘the list of what makes you happy’ was decided back when you
were a clueless, confused kid. And you stuck with that list because it did
bring you momentary happiness from being accepted by and having
relationships with fantasy people, fantasy experiences, and even achieving
some milestones in your career for the approval of these fantasy people. But
the focus on the self consistently remained dormant. Therefore, the result
now is: you know how to be happy in the moment, but you aren’t satisfied
because you have a very distant relationship with your ‘self’. You are still as
clueless about who you are and what makes your ‘self’ happy as you were
fifteen fucking years ago.
As a side note, now you know when philosophers said Know thyself, it
wasn’t some simple thing you didn’t need to think much about, it meant your
fucking life.</li>
<li>I know I shouldn’t be with them, yet I can’t stop loving them. I
can’t stop chasing after them. I can’t move on from that person.
You can’t because a part of you is genuinely convinced that their union with
your existence brings you the ultimate happiness. You feel that way because
of the happiness that you once felt with them, which according to your mind
is ‘the best feeling ever’. And because your goal in life is to be happy, and
you currently don’t know of any other happiness better than what you felt
with them, you obsess over them even though their presence is currently
brutalising you with pain. If you miss them, it’s because they made you
happy once. You miss that particular happiness, not them really. You will
disregard their existence the moment you find it with another person. It’s
because you are a happiness-junkie, that hit of happiness is much more
valuable to you than your self-respect, mental health and the overall
peacefulness in your life. So you say, fuck it, and keep going after that hit.</li>
<li>I know I should be working hard, but I waste my day doing
bullshit things on my phone, being lazy and useless. And because
of that I am filled with regret.
You don’t work, because whatever you do instead of working makes you
happy. It’s as simple as that. You being lazy does not mean you are dead in
those moments. You are still working towards feeling great, quite actively so,
by watching some comedy, drama, commentary, news, animal rescue videos,
or whatever it is that you watch. You do work a lot—except it’s in the
direction of gathering information which is of no use to your real work. So, a
correct way to voice your displeasure is, I was unproductive, not, I didn’t do
anything, because you did plenty of things, they were all just complete shit in
terms of productivity. Things that add betterment to your life aren’t about
making you happy, they’re about hard work. And you consciously choose
momentary happiness over the betterment of your life because you are
fucking addicted to being happy. In short, fuck life in the long term so I can
be happy in the moment, is what you do.</li>
<li>I can’t say ‘no’ to people. Because of this, people often impose
themselves on my wants and feelings and take advantage of my
niceness.
You can’t say ‘no’ because you can’t afford to make people unhappy. If they
are unhappy with you, you are unhappy, and you want to be happy. You may
tell others: I became unhappy because I didn’t get to do what I wanted, but
the real story doesn’t stop there. What you don’t tell them is that the
unhappiness vanishes the moment you see others being happy with you,
despite the fact that you still didn’t get to do what you wanted. People being
happy with you gives you so much pleasure that it feels like a much bigger
reward than what you would feel if you stood up for yourself and said ‘no’.
In short, because happiness is your priority, self-respect is ignored. And that
is why, even though you complain to people about how unhappy it makes
you, you keep repeating it, especially with people you desperately want to
make happy. And you may do that at the cost of working overtime, sleeping
less than planned, disrupting your own plans entirely, all because it gives you
a great burst of pleasure for having ‘helped them’.</li>
<li>I am a dumbass because I have no idea what I want to do, and
others are doing so much better than me.
You are unhappy because others are doing better than you, in which case you
would be happy if you were doing better than others. At any point, the source
of your happiness and unhappiness rests in comparison to others. The act of
comparing yourself has its basis in nothing but simple observation. A
comparison could be triggered from seeing anything and anybody. It could be
as vague as comparing yourself to a celebrity, a person you have met for the
first time, or a person you have only heard about from others. From that, you
conclude: They are better than me. How fucking dumb is that?
It is not a comparison of data as much as it is of your perception of
them. It is you drowning in sorrow because you have assumed they have
something that you don’t, and that something would make you happy. These
assumptions exist only because you have no idea what would make your
‘self’ happy.
And because you don’t know that, the entire focus of your mind is on
the outside, instead of looking inward for the answers. You are busy wanting
what others have, learning what makes others happy, copying the lifestyles
of others, coveting what you don’t have, and as a result developing a deep
sense of disregard and ungratefulness towards what you do have.</li>
<li>Life was so much fun back then, life was great. I wish we could
go back and live like that forever!
The thing is, you were the happiest at your stupidest self—when you were
young, in college, school, with your friends. You were experimenting with
rebellion against structure, engaging in activities that produced rewards (like
gaming), entertainment (with friends) and pleasure (partying, dating, alcohol,
weed, fun). What you don’t realise is that, at that time, you could afford that
experimentation. There was no real structure. You were free of any
responsibilities, duties and consequences. You were in a safe environment.
Now, you are not. What worked then won’t work now because the rules,
environment and your age have changed, but your want to be happy has not.
This explains the confusion as to why the same degree of happiness is not
reachable anymore; hence, you blame ‘growing up’ for it.
If ‘growing up’ was the problem, then you are suggesting a life without
responsibilities, duties and consequences is better, and that is called
escapism. As a kid, your reality was structurally designed to keep you as free
as possible, therefore those wants worked. That reality was manipulated, the
current one is not. Ask any person whose life growing up was a continuous
battle with tragedy, troubles and struggle if they wish to go back, and you
will know the difference. Your responsibilities, duties and consequences pose
as a problem to you because you are a grown-person with the wants of a
clueless kid—to be happy all the time.</li>

Fair argument on the outside, but what it lacks is choice. Manipulation
tends to seriously fuck with your ability to make a rational choice.
Manipulation feeds on weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Anything that is built
on targeting your weakness and naivety, and making you its customer, is
fucking vile because it doesn’t care about you at all. It doesn’t care about
your age, maturity and personal development either. You are a user—that’s
all it cares about.
Most of our wants come from:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Whatever society has made you believe is awesome (conditioning)</li>
<li>whatever you see and have leaerned that others want ( following others )</li>
<li>whatever appears to be exciting to you ( your impulse )</li>
</ul>


<p>
Whatever your wants are, let&rsquo;s divide them into two categories: the first
would be wants that contribute to long-term results; the second would be
wants that bring you momentary happiness. Let&rsquo;s call the first category
<b>value</b>, because they bring value to your life, and lets call the second
<b>interest</b>, because they deal with your actual interests in life.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-1">
<p>
Here’s the truth: nobody cares. Nobody cares unless they have a
personal motive to care. You have rarely looked at how things are from the
point of view of others. If you did, you’d realise that the people you want to
impress can barely afford to think about you.
However, important and powerful people do have the power of offering
opportunities, which must be something you are interested in because of
which you want to impress them. Here’s a simple rule: fuck whatever gossip
goes around in their mind regarding you. Gossip gets discarded and replaced
every day. Lasting impressions are formed by things they cannot ignore. So,
impress with abilities, not appearance. Abilities cannot be ignored; if one
person happens to do so, there are always going to be other takers.
You have to understand, people may not care about you, but they do
make observations. And their approval is nothing more than one of those
many observations. They are not just sitting and thinking about you, but that
observation does sit at the back of their head, with chances of making a
connection with an opportunity. And opportunities as a reward are much
better than appreciation.
Appreciation gives you momentary pleasure. Opportunities get you
somewhere in life. So apply common sense and tell me, which is better?

<h3 id="orgcb0c2d8"><span class="section-number-3">10.2</span> Do you rely on people for the motivation ??</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-10-2">
<p>
Think of the time you attended an event, seminar or conference related
to your work or studies. There you met and talked to people who are experts
in the field, who have superior skills and more success than you. It gave you
immense exposure. While you were there, you felt and thought:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I am going to be great in this too.</li>
<li>Why wasn’t I working hard all this while? If I were, I would have been</li>
</ul>
<p>
impressive too.
Upon returning, you start planning as you experience a surge of inspiration
growing in you, and you think about the things you have been wasting your
time on. You start cursing, criticising and blaming them. You decide in the
moment that you are going to be making changes now and become serious
towards work.
And in about ten days or so, you go back to doing what you were doing
previously. The new-found motivation is gone. Do you know why that is?
Well, at that event, three things happened:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In that room, you saw versions of what you can become in terms of</li>
</ul>
<p>
success and skills.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Your self-worth took a severe beating as you weren’t the impressive</li>
</ul>
<p>
somebody people wanted to talk to or talk about. You were an
unknown who talked to impressive somebodies.
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You met with several people who are competent and awesome in</li>
</ul>
<p>
everybody’s eyes in that room. Therefore, naturally, you wanted to be
approved and accepted by them. One day they’re gonna know.
Hence, the motivation was created by a) wanting success for yourself b)
wanting success so you can show to others that you are worthy and c)
wanting approval and acceptance of the successful people you met.
Two-thirds of your fucking motivation came from the outside, only
one-third from inside. When these others left your mind in ten days or so, so
did two-thirds of your motivation, and you went back to doing the same
things you used to before.
And then you are sitting with your phone in your hand, wondering why
you are not motivated anymore.
As a result, you start glorifying these events in your mind, romanticising
the people you met as though they were perfect beings, and blaming more
strongly the people in your life as if they have tied your hands. It’s because of
them I don’t work hard.
Your problem is your motivation comes from the outside, and you have
labelled outsiders as the ideal source for your motivation. If you want to be
crazily motivated to do anything, a hundred per cent of the reasons to do that
thing will have to come from the inside. Words like ‘others’ and ‘them’ will
have to be replaced by ‘myself’. It should not be I wanna show them, but I
wanna show myself; not I want to be great so they will be impressed, but I
want to be great so I can be satisfied with myself. You have to keep this word
in mind: myself. That’s who you are; that’s the one who gets affected; and
that’s the one whose life it is.
If you are relying on others, you are indirectly controlled by others. And
others don’t give a shit about you.
Now, how do we achieve this? Buckle up, my friend, we’re gonna take
the word ‘myself’ up a few notches and create a new foundational principle:
You are a nation. That’s how you will have to start seeing yourself from now
on. You are a nation in yourself, and I am going to prove it to you.

This means no matter how glamorous, impressive, commanding, rich, celebrated, famous and respected they are, they too have feelings and flaws just like you do.
They too cry, bitch and moan like everybody else. They too struggle to
do many things and face disappointments. They too have inner demons. They
also wonder: what’s the point of everything ?
</p>

<p>
All right, but what about our forefathers, freedom fighters, authors,
scientists, inventors, philosophers, and great historical figures who paved the
way for freedom, equality and justice for future generations? Those who
annulled harmful practices, fought ignorance, prejudice and oppression? Are
we to believe they were not great, perfect men and women? Are the pioneers
of new-age inventions, technology and advancement not worthy of being
followed as perfect examples? Even the ones who lead with principles of
non-violence and total inclusiveness?
</p>

<p>
And you cannot change and become who they are just because you
would like to. It doesn’t work like that. You will remain who you are, so it’s

worthy of being followed and defending them when somebody disagrees with
you or attacks them. You might think, I don’t have to defend anybody, it’s my
choice, I will follow whoever I want.
That’s bullshit. The truth is that your choice to follow them now
represents your intelligence. And failing to defend them makes you look like
an idiot.

You are a fan of their extraordinary acts and the products of their talents, not

So, learn from everybody. Maybe that is why we label people as heroes—
because we are flawed. We need heroes to believe in our hearts that we can
be better, so there is hope for us too. Well, the fact that you want to be better
is the hope. But for that, you don’t have to be like anybody, you already have
